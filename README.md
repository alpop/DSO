# DSO
This library is intended to work with variety of JyeTech scopes. It has simple interface and can be easily added to other projects.<br> 
Supported models:<br>
- DSO068 - fully supported<br>
- DSO112A - partially supported (scope has bugs in serial interface)</br><br>
Other JyeScope scopes that support serial interface (DSO094, DSO082 etc.) should work in DSO068 mode but this is untested.<br>
