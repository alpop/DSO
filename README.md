For now this project contains a very basic gui for mainly testing purposes. It offers very limited funcionality but works. Gui is not part of this project, it is attached in ZIP file available at Release tab:<br>

Separate GitHub project with gui will be open when basics of new interface and all other stuff will be clarified.
